# Sentinel-9 🔐  
**Continuous Intent-Based Security System**

Sentinel-9 is a web-based prototype that demonstrates **continuous intent verification** to prevent **silent intent hijacking**, especially in Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) and high-risk authentication environments.

Unlike traditional one-time authentication, Sentinel-9 continuously evaluates **user intent**, not just identity.
