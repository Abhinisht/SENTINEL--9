# Sentinel-9 🔐  
**Continuous Intent-Based Security System**

Sentinel-9 is a web-based prototype that demonstrates **continuous intent verification** to prevent **silent intent hijacking**, especially in Brain–Computer Interface (BCI) and high-risk authentication environments.

Unlike traditional one-time authentication, Sentinel-9 continuously evaluates **user intent**, not just identity.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Continuous intent verification (not one-time login)
- Behavioral & cognitive signal monitoring
- User-specific behavioral baseline learning
- Real-time intent mismatch detection
- Adaptive security responses (allow / block / step-up)
- Privacy-safe, non-invasive design

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn-ui
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **State & UI:** Modern component-based architecture
- **Styling:** Utility-first responsive design

Continuous Intent Verification for Secure Human–AI Interaction

Sentinel-9 is a cybersecurity prototype that protects human intent in next-generation systems such as Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and AI-assisted applications.

Traditional security verifies identity once.
Sentinel-9 verifies intent continuously.

🚨# Problem: The Silent Hijack

As human–machine interaction evolves, new security gaps emerge:

Authentication remains valid after login

# Behavioral or neural signals can be intercepted or manipulated

Malicious actions execute without breaking authentication

This results in Silent Hijacking —
where identity is verified, but intent is compromised.

💡 #Solution Overview

Sentinel-9 introduces Semantic Intent Verification, a security layer that continuously evaluates whether actions being executed align with the authorized user’s genuine intent.

Instead of trusting access once, Sentinel-9 monitors intent throughout the session lifecycle.

Identity can be stolen. Intent cannot.

🧠 Core Concept: Semantic Intent Verification

Sentinel-9 builds a user-specific behavioral baseline and compares it with real-time interaction signals.

Signals analyzed include:

Behavioral rhythm and interaction timing

Contextual and semantic consistency

Stress-related deviation patterns

 # Decision Logic

✅ Allow — intent matches baseline

⚠️ Step-up verification — uncertain intent

❌ Block & isolate — malicious deviation

🏗️ # System Architecture (Triple-Lock Model)
🔐 Lock 1 — Hardware Trust (mTLS)

Mutual TLS authentication between client and server

Prevents spoofed or unauthorized devices

🔐 Lock 2 — Session Isolation (Docker Sandbox)

Each user session runs in a stateless container

Containers self-destruct on threat detection

🔐 Lock 3 — Semantic Firewall (Layer-9)

AI-driven intent analysis engine

Acts as a cognitive firewall during active sessions

🧩 Adaptive Multimodal Security

Sentinel-9 is designed for real human behavior, not ideal conditions.

No single biometric is mandatory

Temporary stress or impairment does not cause lockout

Intent is inferred from multiple weak signals

System degrades gracefully instead of failing harshly

This ensures both security and usability.
